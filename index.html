      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
      <p> This website was made in CSC class to help me learn how to create my own website and it is an amazing feeling to know i was able to. The website is to get to know me and there's also a javascript page. In the webpage about me you will get to know more about me. You will know what type of foods I like to eat, you will find out about my family, hobbies and even fun facts about me. Hopefully you enjoy getting to know me. </p>
      <p>Thanks for visiting. </p>
